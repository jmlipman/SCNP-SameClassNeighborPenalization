# SCNP — Same-Class Neighbor Penalization
Official repository of "**Towards High-Quality Image Segmentation: Improving Topology Accuracy by Penalizing Neighbor Pixels** (CVPR 26).

SCNP is an efficient method to improve topology accuracy by simply applying Min and MaxPooling to the logits.
We show its effectiveness on 13 datasets, including medical, non-medical datasets, datasets with tubular and non-tubular structures, single- and multi-class datasets, and on semantic and instance segmentation.

This repository contains our implementation of SCNP, the files required to run our experiments.

### Latest updates
